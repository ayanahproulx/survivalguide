    <h3> <b> take good notes and do them through code<b> <br>
	-my first mistake was not understanding how to take notes, I initially did the normal pen and paper notetaking way. This caused my info to be everywhere and not easily accessible <br>

<h5>***Where do I find the assignment? Where do I actually code? Was that on Atom, or was it Github or no maybe on Slack?*** </h5>
<br>
Make sure you focus on Atom!! <br>
	-notes are so important when you want to remeber some fancy code manueuver!!
<h5> ***oh shoot how do I do a smooth scrool??***
***dont worry ayanah I have it in my notes!!!*** </h5>

<h2>&#64;advice.number.4 &#123; </h2>
<h3> <b> utilize justins skills</b> <br>
-Justin is so passionate in both code and teaching <br>
	-You may feel stupid at first (trust me I get it, and coding takes a long time to finally smush into your brain) but ask for help, slack him whenever!!<br>
	-Make sure you ask instead of pretending you’ll do it later, ask now and solve later if needed. (This was someting I lacked for the last project. My semester was crazy so when I had a question I foudn myself lacking the time to ask for help when I should have been slacking (haha get it lacking - slacking haha)) <br>

<h2>&#64;advice.number.5 &#123; </h2>
<h3> <b> have fun </b> <br>
  -Last but not least don’t get too stressed. Yes it is like learning Spanish in 3 months and then trying to speak it fluently.. but you know what you can do it!! and this language isn’t Spanish it is coding which makes you feel like a cool robot!! <br>
	- Justin is a great teacher and won’t make you feel stupid or anything so you dont have to stress at all!! If you put in effort you’ll get an A (A for effort!! (or maybe a B but still a good grade.))
